Python Exercises
==================
This repository contains program files relating the problems/exercises given as part of 
the Continious Assesment for the Programming and Scripting module.

The five Python files that have been saved are as follows:
  # fibonacci.py   
  This file is modified code created by Ian McLoughlan, it creates the the Fibonacci number based on a given word/name in this case the name "Sweeney"
  # collatz.py
  This program takes a number inputted by the user and test the Collatz Conjecture on that number. This means that in an attempt to get to the the number one, the inputted number is halved, if the reslutant number is even then the it can be halved again and so on. If the number is not even then it is multiplied by 3, with 1 added to the resulting number, this number is then halved and so on. 
  # euler.py
  This program is an attempt to solve the Euler [problem No.5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5). This problem require one to find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.
